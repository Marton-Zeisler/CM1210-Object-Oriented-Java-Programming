# CM1210-Object-Oriented-Java-Programming
Mastering fundamental programming and problem solving skills necessary to develop an understanding of Object Oriented Programming

## Description
The aim of this module is to provide students with the fundamental programming and problem solving skills necessary to develop an understanding of Object Oriented Programming. It will also introduce fundamental data structures and algorithms used in Computational systems. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for future taught modules. Focus on Object Oriented Design will be delivered through the use of core worked examples that will be built upon throughout lab-based sessions.
